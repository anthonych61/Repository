// The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. 
// Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches. The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. 

// The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:
// -If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
// -Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.

// This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.
// You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i​​​​​​th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of 
// the j​​​​​​th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). 
// Return the number of students that are unable to eat.
