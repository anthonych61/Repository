// Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.
// It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.
 
// The solution is to copy the data from the next node to the node to be deleted and delete the next node. Something like this:
// It is important to note that this approach will only work if it is guaranteed that the given pointer does not point to the last node. 
// Because if it is the last node, then you donâ€™t have a next node to copy the data from.
